### 3.7v BMS
A 3.7V BMS is a device that manages the charging and discharging of a 3.7V lithium-ion battery. It monitors and regulates the battery's voltage and current to ensure safe and efficient operation. The BMS also includes protective features to prevent overcharging, over-discharging, and short-circuiting. It is commonly used in portable electronics, electric vehicles, and renewable energy systems.


### 5v BMS
A 5V BMS is a device that manages the charging and discharging of a 5V lithium-ion battery. It monitors and regulates the battery's voltage and current to ensure safe and efficient operation. The BMS also includes protective features to prevent overcharging, over-discharging, and short-circuiting. It is commonly used in electronic devices, renewable energy systems, and other applications that require a 5V power source.


### 7v,12v BMS
Same Descritpion as the 2 BMSs above. Although the functionality is applied for 7v and 12v
